6.8.0
BACKEND
Created general purpose dragdropfilesdll.dll to handle drag and drop from application to Windows 32 and 64 bit systems, built from DragDropLazarus Lazarus package (which is required only for compiling the dll), which is based on work of Angus Johnson & Anders Melander (on Delphi), and Michael Kï¿½cher / six (on Lazarus)

Various fixes

FILE MANAGER
Drag and drop extraction results in hiding the main form, consistently to behavior from Extraction and Archiving screens

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Extraction: "Smart new folder" option improves and replaces "Remove redundant directory" option
if the new folder contains a single object (file or folder), content is copied outside and the extra folder is removed (removes extra folder layer and preserves original names of archived folders), if copying the content outside the new folder fails, the content is kept in the new folder
smart extraction is meant to guarantee that a single item is extracted, to avoid flooding target directory of multiple unexpected items, and that no unneeded level of directory nesting is added
Improved GUI feedback during preliminary steps of archives conversion and "TAR before" procedures
Improved GUI feedback running option to delete original sources
Improved information shown about running archiving / extraction tasks

WINDOWS & LINUX INSTALLERS
(Windows) Extraction from context menu results in a single queue consistently with behavior from Extraction screen, and consistently with archiving from context menu
(Windows) "Extract here (to new folder)" context menu entry now enforces creation of new folder level (disable smart new folder)
(Windows) "Extract here (smart)" context menu entry (new) enforces using smart new folder option
this item is now flagged by default during installation in place of "Extract here (to new folder)"- can be changed during installation

upper progress bar shows progress of the current task, progress bar on the bottom of the form shows overall progress (if multiple tasks are launched)
Previewing files in archive can now be disallowed - avoids leftover data even in cases of system crash or if the application is forcedly arrested - setting Working path to new option "None (no preview)"
Command line switch -ext2full remapped to -ext2main, in order to avoid duplication of analogous functions now main program's extraction form is the standard UI for full featured extraction
